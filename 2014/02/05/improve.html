		<p>I am not the best fighting game player. But I'm also not the
			average player. I have not won any majors. I've won a couple of local
			tournaments here and there but nothing else that would distinguish me
			from any other tournament player. But even so, becoming an
			above-average skill player was not by luck.</p>

		<p>
			Through my experiences I have traveled to many tournaments and
			gathered enough knowledge to know what it takes to be more than <i>just
				another player</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this article I will explain what it takes to rise above the
			average skill level in your area and why certain players in your
			community always seem to dominate the scene despite having <i>played
				X game less than you</i> or make it look like <i>they are naturally
				that good</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Becoming great at anything requires equally great effort. Unless you
			are immensely talented this will mean hours of <a

				practice</a> and <a
				href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/22/on-the-value-of-hard-focus/">deep
				focus</a>. No matter what it is you want to improve at just remember
			that in the grand scheme of things, <b>hard work and effort
				trumps talent</b>. Only in the highest level of competition does talent
			even become a factor worth mentioning. To put into numbers we can say
			that being great requires 90% hard work, 5% talent, and 5% luck.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>In other words, your path to greatness is paved in blood.</b>
		</p>

		<h2>The Correct Mindset</h2>

		<p>The mindset of a great player exudes confidence. Without
			confidence you cannot follow through with your actions in good faith.
		</p>

		<p>The mindset of a great player is infused with positive
			thinking. Every positive thought put into action is a step closer
			towards greatness. This includes setting goals and taking positive
			steps towards achieving them. Without this a player will let their
			frustrations get the best of them hindering their path to greatness.</p>

		<p>The mindset of a great player is objective. These players are
			critical of their own play and make adjustments according to
			impartial and unbiased evaluation. Feedback, whether it is positive
			or negative, is important in facilitating this effort.</p>

		<p>These are the core components that I believe make up great
			players.</p>

		<h2>Learning to Lose</h2>
		<p>Sometimes players will lose. The difference is how the player
			reacts to their losses. A great player cannot be passive about their
			losses whereas an average player is more likely to be. A great player
			sees losses as small stories hidden with lessons yet to be learned.
			They take their losses in full, seldom blaming the result on factors
			other than things they can control.</p>

		<p>
			<b>"When you lose, don't lose the lesson."</b>
		</p>

		<h2>Preparing to Win</h2>
		<p>Great players take effort in their preparations towards
			winning. To win you must prepare to do so. This where a huge amount
			of your hard work will be put towards in terms of improving at
			fighting games. The preparation towards becoming great at X fighting
			game can be broken into a few steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Learn the game's system and mechanics.</li>
			<li>Pick and learn a character.</li>
			<li>Learn how this character works under the game's mechanics.</li>
			<li>Acquire knowledge to test out (training mode, reading,
				watching match-videos or replays).</li>
			<li>Apply knowledge by actually playing "real matches". Discard
				what didn't work and keep what did.</li>
			<li>Repeat steps 4-5 as needed.</li>
		</ol>


		<p>Step 1 through 3 should be fairly straightforward. Intimate
			knowledge of how the game actually works goes hand-in-hand with how
			well a character can play. Learning a character includes learning
			spacing with their normals, learning how good their core mechanics
			are (reversals, rolls, backdash, short-hop, etc.), bread and butter
			combos from different hit confirms, and so forth.</p>
		<p>Steps 4 and 5 hold the biggest weight. Acquiring knowledge and
			knowing how to apply it properly is key. If you stick with just
			playing real matches and don't explore much of your character in
			training mode then your potential for improvement is substantially
			smaller compared to someone who does.</p>
		<p></p>

		<p>
			<b>Knowledge fuels growth. A balance between training mode and
				matches facilitates this growth.</b>
		</p>

		<h4>Deliberate Practice</h4>
		<p>Training mode allows you to find answers to any question you
			may have about your character. Don't know any safe block strings?
			Test it in training mode and apply it the next time you have a real
			match. Experiment. Never stop learning things about your character.</p>

		<p>Those players in your area that make it seem effortless and
			don't seem to play as much is simply because they know how to invest
			their time towards improvement. The number of hours you practice does
			not amount to anything if it is not towards the right kind of
			practice. Training mode isn't just for learning combos and repeating
			them ad infinitum. Combos can lead to wins, but just as important is
			creating those opportunities which allow you to perform them.</p>

		<h4>Deep Focus</h4>
		<p>
			What you are aiming for through the acquisition of knowledge is to
			minimize any unfamiliarity during any match. <b>You should always
				be in control when you play your matches.</b> What this means is
			constant awareness of your options at any moment in any match.
			Training mode helps confirm what these options might be. If you
			encounter any unfamiliar situations in a match you should recreate
			this situation later and explore your options to fully understand
			what is going on.
		</p>

		<h2>In Summary</h2>
		<p>Improving at fighting games takes the right kind of effort.
			While I have not won a major (yet!) I think what I have written here
			is the foundation for a player that might one day win one.</p>
