          <h2>The Path to Greatness is Paved in Blood</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Apr 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<h1>introduction</h1>

<p>I am not the best fighting game player. But I&#39;m also not the
average player. I have not won any majors. I&#39;ve won a couple of local
tournaments here and there but nothing else that would distinguish me from any
other tournament player. But even so, becoming an above-average skill player
was not by luck.</p>

<p>Through my experiences I have traveled to many
tournaments and gathered enough knowledge to know what it takes to be more than
just another player.</p>

<p>In this article I will explain what it takes to rise
above the average skill level in your area and why certain players in your
community always seem to dominate the scene despite having played X game less
than you or make it look like they are naturally that good.</p>

<p>Becoming great at anything requires equally great
effort. Unless you are immensely talented this will mean hours of deliberate
practice and deep focus. No matter what it is you want to improve at just
remember that in the grand scheme of things, hard work and effort trumps talent.
Only in the highest level of competition does talent even become a factor worth
mentioning. To put into numbers we can say that being great requires 90% hard
work, 5% talent, and 5% luck.</p>

<p><em>In other words, your path to greatness is paved in blood.</em></p>

<h2>The Correct Mindset</h2>

<p>The mindset of a great player exudes confidence. Without
confidence you cannot follow through with your actions in good faith.</p>

<p>The mindset of a great player is infused with positive thinking.
Every positive thought put into action is a step closer towards greatness. This
includes setting goals and taking positive steps towards achieving them. Without
this a player will let their frustrations get the best of them hindering their
path to greatness.</p>

<p>The mindset of a great player is objective. These players are
critical of their own play and make adjustments according to impartial and
unbiased evaluation. Feedback, whether it is positive or negative, is important
in facilitating this effort.</p>

<p>These are the core components that I believe make up great
players.</p>

<h2>Learning to Lose</h2>

<p>Sometimes players will lose. The difference is
how the player reacts to their losses. A great player cannot be passive about
their losses whereas an average player is more likely to be. A great player sees
losses as small stories hidden with lessons yet to be learned.  They take their
losses in full, seldom blaming the result on factors other than things they can
control.</p>

<p><em>&quot;When you lose, don&#39;t lose the lesson.&quot;</em></p>

<h2>Preparing to Win</h2>

<p>Great players take effort in their preparations
towards winning. To win you must prepare to do so. This where a huge amount of
your hard work will be put towards in terms of improving at fighting games. The
preparation towards becoming great at X fighting game can be broken into a few
steps:</p>

<p>Learn the game&#39;s system and mechanics. Pick and learn a
character. Learn how this character works under the game&#39;s mechanics. Acquire
knowledge to test out (training mode, reading, watching match-videos or replays).
Apply knowledge by actually playing &quot;real matches&quot;. Discard what
didn&#39;t work and keep what did. Repeat steps 4-5 as needed.</p>

<p>Step 1 through 3 should be fairly straightforward. Intimate
knowledge of how the game actually works goes hand-in-hand with how well a
character can play. Learning a character includes learning spacing with their
normals, learning how good their core mechanics are (reversals, rolls, backdash,
short-hop, etc.), bread and butter combos from different hit confirms, and so
forth. Steps 4 and 5 hold the biggest weight. Acquiring knowledge and knowing
how to apply it properly is key. If you stick with just playing real matches and
don&#39;t explore much of your character in training mode then your potential for
improvement is substantially smaller compared to someone who does.</p>

<p><em>Knowledge fuels growth. A balance between training mode and matches 
facilitates this growth.</em></p>

<h2>Deliberate Practice</h2>

<p>Training mode allows you to find answers to
any question you may have about your character. Don&#39;t know any safe block
strings?  Test it in training mode and apply it the next time you have a real
match. Experiment. Never stop learning things about your character.</p>

<p>Those players in your area that make it seem effortless and
don&#39;t seem to play as much is simply because they know how to invest their time
towards improvement. The number of hours you practice does not amount to
anything if it is not towards the right kind of practice. Training mode isn&#39;t
just for learning combos and repeating them ad infinitum. Combos can lead to
wins, but just as important is creating those opportunities which allow you to
perform them.</p>

<h2>Deep Focus</h2>

<p>What you are aiming for through the acquisition of
knowledge is to minimize any unfamiliarity during any match. You should always
be in control when you play your matches. What this means is constant awareness
of your options at any moment in any match.  Training mode helps confirm what
these options might be. If you encounter any unfamiliar situations in a match
you should recreate this situation later and explore your options to fully
understand what is going on.</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Improving at fighting games takes the right kind of
effort. While I have not won a major (yet!) I think what I have written here is
the foundation for a player that might one day win one.</p>
