These answers will bring you to the core of Umehara's technique of timing his Hadoukens known as the legendary Ume Hadou!<div><br/></div><div><br/></div>* Before you try to think of the best ways to use projectiles, you must first understand what purpose they serve in fighting games *<div><br/></div>Morikawa: Today's question is about how to use the Hadouken. Yeah, this is one for Umehara. Many people seem to view your Hadouken as a magical fireball that you stop throwing out only when an opponent jumps - I used to, as well. It seems that to be good at fighting games, you need to balance your use of two types of projectiles - &quot;safe&quot; projectiles that allow you to anti-air an opponent's jumps, and &quot;unsafe&quot; projectiles that will get you seriously damaged if they jump. Of course, use the safe ones, but many normal players wonder why they don't get the results you do when using them in unsafe situations.<div><br/></div>Umehara: Ah. Well, an opponent can get a lot of damage if they read an unsafe fireball correctly, so it makes sense that they see less use at higher levels of play.<div><br/></div>M: True, but I know that there are times in battle where you have to use them. There's one method in particular I'd like to ask about. Back when I first started to learn Ryu in Street Fighter Alpha 3 and watched a lot of your videos, I wondered why you used so many unsafe projectiles in seemingly unsafe situations. I thought that maybe there was some technique behind it besides you having lots of experience and making great reads. The first one I noticed was your &quot;Confirmation fireball.&quot; It seemed to me that whether you'd sometimes open a round with a Hadouken and whether you'd fire another one immediately after depended on the opponent - in that critical moment where they choose to either jump over it or guard it, you would, in that tiny fraction of a second, confirm that they hadn't jumped and fire another Hadouken. Even in situations where you're both sitting at neutral and you fire one raw, you still confirm their forward walk. When you see them walking forward, it signals that it's highly likely you'll be looking at a grounded fight. Since your speed in confirming situations is extraordinarily fast, as we all know, it almost looks like you're just throwing them out as fast as you can half the time. Once I realized this, I started to jump less.<div><br/></div>U: That certainly is one method, but at the end of the day, it's just one method. I won't say it's the essence of it, but before you try to think of the best ways to use projectiles, you must first understand what purpose they serve in fighting games.<div><br/></div><div><br/></div>*Fighting games are fun because of the differences between characters, and projectiles are the most obvious difference.*<div><br/></div>U: First, they open the door to long range fighting, a tactic not available in games with parrying such as the Street Fighter III series or in 3D fighters. The existence of a long-ranged battle greatly changes the importance of the close-ranged battle. When neither player has projectiles, there's a bit of ambiguity in how one attacks. But when one character can fight from a distance, it makes the other, who absolutely must close that distance to fight, feel he absolutely must keep up his pressure once he does. It's more than something that makes fights interesting - it's an essential part of them. Because fighting games are enjoyable because of the different roles characters play. After all, mirror matches are usually boring to watch, right? Anyway, I feel that whether a character has a projectile or not is the easiest difference to understand. Fighting games began with the original Street Fighter II, but if it didn't have projectiles when it came out, I feel it would have been a boring game and might not have been the giant hit that it was. It'd hurt the offensive game if they were gone right? Even if you did nothing, you'd never have to worry about anything chipping away at your health. Actually, I've heard of a tournament where they ran a match where the first person who attacked lost. Every round ended in a draw with neither player doing anything, so they eventually decided the victor by rock-paper-scissors.<div><br/></div>M: How horrifying. (laughs)<div><br/></div>U: I know, right? It's a funny anecdote, but we can't play fighting games like that. That's why projectiles are essential to making 2D fighters fun, though it's okay if some other mechanic can fill that role - for example, something like the Vampire series' strengthened overheads and Guard Crush mechanics would be fine. It's not just fighting games that get boring when you have no incentive to attack - you always have to make a move in Chess and Shogi, too. It'd make Shogi pretty dull if you could pass on your turn like in a card game, no? There are people that say projectiles are bad because they hinder your movement and limit your freedom, but there's a story born in the fight between a long range character and a close range character. Without any kind of story, you can't read your opponent. It's when both sides are restricted in their actions that strategies are born and the strong are separated from the weak.<div><br/></div>M: I see. So basically, projectiles have the power to restrict the opponent's actions, and your style in fighting games comes from the compulsion born from that.<div><br/></div>U: Exactly, though it seems the trend in recent fighting games is to weaken projectiles. They're easy to dodge on reaction and to counter-attack. One might say they're designed to make the mid- and close-ranged games more fun, but I don't think that's quite it. I'm just surprised that they're making games like the original Street Fighter but without projectiles after all this time. I just want to be clear that I'm not saying to make projectile characters strong, though. If you make a character's projectiles relatively strong, make other areas relatively weak. It's important to have variety.<div><br/></div>M: I agree with that. It's no fun to watch a match where neither side has any incentive to attack, either. It just turns it into a waste of time, which I doubt arcade owners would be fond of, either. (laughs)<div><br/></div>* What is a character's ultimate goal? If you don't understand, you fear the character's riskier moves. *<div><br/></div>U: Well, I said projectiles were important, but you can't have everyone shoot them, right? Where's the fun in that? (laughs)<div><br/></div>M: I get too scared to throw them out sometimes, sorry. (laughs)<div><br/></div>U: Well then, here's a friendly tip from me to you. (laughs) What you really have to do is think about what the ultimate goal for your character is. And don't say &quot;win the round.&quot; (laughs) They all want to do that. But to do that, you have to think about what the most advantageous positions and most effective moves they can utilize are. The projectile is not a goal in itself, but simply a tool used to help reach it. That said, when you see the projectile itself, you can't help but rack your brain trying to figure out what it's used for. And you have to understand what a risky move is useful for, otherwise you'll be too scared to use it.<div><br/></div>M: You can't mistake your tools for your goal. The moment you do, you stop focusing on the risks vs. rewards and stop seeing the big picture - you get cocky and fire projectiles recklessly as long as you think it could lead to any kind of reward. But how exactly does one achieve their goal?<div><br/></div>U: Well, it varies by game and character, but if I were to pick one thing relatively important in just about every game, it'd be to chase your opponent into the corner. For example, take the match between Ryu and Guile in Super Turbo. While fighting midscreen, Ryu can't get many decisive blows on Guile, but once he corners him, he can rush Guile down hard. Ryu's strongest tool in this matchup is his sweep (crouching Roundhouse) cancelled into Hadouken. If the sweep hits, Ryu will score a knockdown, and even if it's blocked, it pushes Guile closer into the corner. But Guile has his own powerful projectile, the Sonic Boom, so you have to use your Hadoukens well to get close. Put simply, the most effective way to win the round is to corner your opponent. Your most effective tool to do so is your sweep Hadouken, and to earn the right to use that tool, you need to use your Hadouken. See? These projectiles are tools we use to gain the advantage, not the end goal itself.<div><br/></div>M: Speaking of which, if you used the fireball confirming tactic we talked about earlier, it can let you get that first fireball off, but I realized I was getting caught up and that my idea of what role they played was lacking. It's a tactic that doesn't let you see the forest for the trees. (laughs) Are there any other tricks to it? There are, right? C'mon, I'm cool, you can tell me.<div><br/></div>U: I wouldn't call it a &quot;trick,&quot; but I'll talk about the first time I really felt the power of projectile characters. There was a player I met back when I only played Super Turbo. At the time, he was much stronger than me and beat me soundly. As far as projectiles ago, I suppose I could call him my teacher. One day, he said to me, &quot;Yo Ume. I noticed somethin' about fireballs back in Street Fighter II. You ain't off the ground for more than like a second in this game, so I think you oughta quit shooting fireballs for that second. Then you'd never lose.&quot; When I heard that, it finally clicked. It's so simple, but I guess you could say that about all of Street Fighter II. It's a powerful skill in battle to be able to simplify such seemingly complex concepts and put them into words like he could. Like you said when we began, it takes courage to fire a projectile. So to keep firing them, you need something to believe in. The reason I keep firing projectiles is because I have faith that it's safest to KEEP firing them. If I were to compare projectiles to something, it'd be a car. You can't just not use cars because you're scared of getting into an accident, right? Using a projectile is scary. The fighting game genre is young, so there are still people who don't think of projectiles as safe. Well, not that that applies too much to recent games.<div><br/></div><div><br/></div>* Umehara talks about how to use the Shoryuken! *<div><br/></div>M: Related to our discussion of the Hadouken, how do you use so many Shoryukens? If I focus too much on the ground game, I find myself unable to react when they jump. I hear a lot that you're supposed to split your focus between both the air and ground. You always seem ready to Shoryuken, what's your secret? (laughs)<div><br/></div>U: There's another story for that. There used to be a guy who was really good at Super Turbo. I wanted to have a peek at how he played, and I saw first saw him fight against a Zangief. I'd never seen someone confirm Zangief's jumps and respond with a Shoryuken like he could before, but he anti-aired every time. And it was on Turbo 4! Since then, I started trying to Shoryuken to the point of stubbornness, though I failed a lot at first and ate plenty of jump-ins. But I kept looking up while fighting and eventually became able to do it, and before I knew it, I didn't even need to look up anymore. It's just repetition, you know?<div><br/></div>M: Yeah, I thought so. Well, how about talking about all those gamble Shoryukens you get? How do you do it? Tell me!<div><br/></div>U: I dunno, I'm godlike?<div><br/></div>M: Ahaha.<div><br/></div>U: Well, that was a joke, but I do have another story.<div><br/></div>M: Oh, well then go right ahead.<div><br/></div>U: Back to Street Fighter II again, an acquaintance told me there was someone really good at landing gamble Shoryukens. That person had already given up Street Fighter II by the time I'd heard that story, so I never got to see his play in person, but it was something I really wanted to learn, so I tried out a lot of different ideas. Once I was confident in my skill, I fought the acquaintance, hit a bunch of gamble Shoryukens, and was surprised to hear that my style was like the person's he mentioned. I had nothing but my imagination to go off while training, so it was hard. Sorry, guess you just have to be godlike.<div><br/></div>M: Aw, shaddup.<div><br/></div>U: In all seriousness, you need to have a sixth sense for it to some extent, but if you keep working at it, you'll start to understand what you should look for.<div><br/></div>M: So, are you sure you've never just made what looked like amazing reads but was actually just you going ham?<div><br/></div>U: Huh? Like when?<div><br/></div>M: Back when I saw you playing Capcom vs. SNK 2, you fought against a Ken who used RCed Nataotoshi Geri (By taking a move with short recovery and applying the Roll Cancel technique to give it increased invincibility, you can create a powerful poke) and punished the hole in its offense with Dictator's slide kick every time. It may have been the best damage you could get, but even though you were in a position where you could have punished with a safer move, you kept slide kicking. I mean, the slide's super punishable if you mess it up. More recently, when you fought against an El Fuerte in the God's Garden Dream Battle (http://youtu.be/ouuflgpKDbU ), you just kept moving forward. That was totally going ham. (laughs)<div><br/></div>U: Ah, I see what you mean. I was asserting myself. I think that to an extent, fighting games turn into clashes of assertion at a high level. Like &quot;I'm right,&quot; or &quot;I'm beautiful,&quot; or &quot;I'm better.&quot; If it were just about winning, everyone would pick the strongest character and that would be that, but it doesn't end up that way. Everyone wants to express themselves in their play, which is why character choices and playstyles differ. Take the slide kick - you need good reads and good reactions to counter with it, right? You can't throw it out whenever. That's why I feel I have to do it whenever I have the chance. It's something that can only be said with actions - no matter how good I say my reads or reactions were, nobody will understand unless they see it on screen. Otherwise, I won't be expressing the real me. That's just something I've been thinking about.<div><br/></div>*AFTER TALK*<div><br/></div>Umehara: It's been a long time since I've read this over, and it's great! (laughs) I can't believe I put out such a good talk for the first column! Nothing in here seemed pointless - I thought it all rang true. I haven't drifted from any of the opinions in this piece.<div><br/></div>Morikawa: Well gee, you DID write it. (laughs).<div><br/></div>Editor: This article was published just before you became a pro gamer.<div><br/></div>U: Well, who knew there was such a bright amateur out there! (laughs) Everything in here is pretty deep.<div><br/></div>M: When we were putting this together, we wanted people with a shallower understanding of fighting games to read it, so we wanted to cover the important points. The question asked how to use Hadoukens, but the first half was about the idea of enjoying the game based on character differences. The second half was about creating advantageous positions one small step at a time, one of the foundations of fighting games. So the talk wasn't entirely about projectiles.</div></div>
