Capcom's detailed change logs for existing characters in Ultra Street Fighter 4 are a great way to quickly catch up on what the buffs and nerfs for each character are -- but they're not for everyone. <br/><br/>If you aren't already super familiar with the ins and outs of a particular character, the significance of each individual change may be lost on you.<br/><br/>To help players understand the character changes better, the official website for the arcade version of USF4 <a href="http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2014/apr/03/sagat-will-be-very-powerful-character-ultra-bonchan-details-and-shows-sagats-ideal-playstyle-and-changes-ultra-sf4/" target="_blank">has<sup>[2]</sup></a> been <a href="http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2014/apr/06/makoto-has-become-character-who-can-quickly-ko-opponents-even-mid-screen-shirou-explains-ultra-street-fighter-4s-makoto-changes-and-playstyle/" target="_blank">posting<sup>[3]</sup></a> character breakdown videos -- and this week, Mad Catz sponsored players Daigo Umehara and Mago are doing the same for Ryu and Oni respectively.<br/><br/>Daigo talked about how the changes to Ryu translated into a much better risk/return conversion ratio whenever you go for a Shoryuken FADC.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mago picked out a few of Oni's numerous buffs to focus on, and discussed how players could change their play style to take advantage of them.<br/><br/>Hit the jump to see the character breakdown vids for Ryu and Oni, as well as written transcripts of what Daigo and Mago said in the videos, translated by EventHubs's very own KarbyP.

Hi, this is Mad Catz's (Daigo) Umehara. I'm a Ryu user.<br/><br/>Ryu is a character with all-around capabilities and a projectile. He also has the Shoryuken, an anti-air move with invincibility frames. And the Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku, which moves him across the screen.<br/><br/>Equipped with these three special moves, Ryu is a character whose play style is considered to be incredibly &quot;orthodox&quot;.<br/><br/>In terms of changes made to Ryu in USF4... one of Ryu's most commonly used tools in a match, the cr.MK, now gives your opponent +1 more frame of block stun when it's guarded. As a result... when you cancel cr.MK into Hadouken, there are more situations where this is a true block string during which your opponent has to guard both moves consecutively [as opposed to being able to interrupt with a reversal move between cr.MK and Hadouken].<br/><br/>Some other key changes made to Ryu in USF4 include being able to cancel the first hit of jump MP into a special move. This allows you to combo from jump MP into an aerial Tatsumaki, allowing for more combo possibilities, such as Shoryuken FADC jump MP xx aerial Tatsumaki. This particular combo greatly improves the risk-return trade-off for doing a Shoryuken FADC.<br/><br/>But perhaps the most significant change made to Ryu is the ability to combo into Metsu Shoryuken Ultra 2 (with full animation) from the first hit of an EX Shoryuken after an FADC.<br/><br/>Overall, the improvements made for Ryu this time around in USF4 are buffs that players can take advantage of without necessarily changing their existing play style with the character. Personally I think that many of the changes here  are those that Ryu players will be quite happy about.<br/><br/>At the moment, there are a great number of Ryu players who always stick with UC1 Metsu Hadouken when picking their Ultra.<br/><br/>But now that you can combo from the first hit of EX Shoryuken (FADC) into UC2 Metsu Shoryuken... I believe this is a change that widens the strategeic possibilities with Ryu, making it feasible to pick UC2 Metsu Shoryuken or Ultra Combo Double in more situations. This is something I'm quite happy about.</div>

Hi, this is MCZ|Mago.<br/><br/>To put it in the simplest terms possible, Oni is essentially a projectile-type character. He possesses a projectile move, as well as the Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku (Hurricane Kick) and Shoryuken special moves -- so basically he has all of the &quot;orthodox&quot; Street Fighter tools.<br/><br/>But with that said, there are quite a few differences that separates Oni from Ryu and other such projectile-type characters. For instance, Oni's fireball does not travel all the way across the screen. The recovery for his projectile move is also a little on the long side.<br/><br/>In return, Oni has more offensive capabilities when compared to Ryu and the other Shotos -- and that's what is perhaps the most alluring trait about Oni. The reason players pick Oni over other characters.<br/><br/>The USF4 iteration of Oni has had many changes made to it over its SSF4 AE2012 counterpart. <br/><br/>The most significant change of them all, is with Oni's cr.HK sweep. The start-up for cr.HK has been made faster, and its recovery frames has been shortened as well, making it that much more useful as a footsie tool. <br/><br/>The other major change is with the reach of Oni's focus attack. In AE2012, the reach of Oni's focus attack was considered rather short, when compared to that of the entire cast. Over here in USF4, the reach is longer, making it easier to do certain combos that require Oni's focus attack or a red focus attack.<br/><br/>Oni's Demon Slash (Sekisei Jiraiken) special move has also been buffed. Up till now, it's been a move that is considered unsafe since it can be punished on block. In USF4, however, the Demon Slash's frame disadvantage on block has been reduced, making it less likely to be punished.<br/><br/>In exchange for less frame disadvantage on block, however, the medium version of Demon Slash no longer has invulnerability properties on the first frame of its start-up animation, which makes it a little less effective as a reversal option. The move still puts Oni in an aeriel state from the second frame onwards.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, although in the previous version I found Oni's offensive options to be a little on the weaker side, now that his cr.HK sweep has been made stronger, and more of his offensive tools are more viable, I feel that in USF4, Oni players can adopt a more offensive play style, rather than wait for their opponent to come to them.</div>

                       <p>Good call.</p>

<p>If you read between the lines with Bonchan and Mago too, its as if all of them have been coerced into ignoring the -5 FADC DP change.</p>

<p>Since all of these players have relied on it heavily in the last 5 years.<br/>That muscle memory doesn't disappear overnight!</p>

<p>Any recent high level videos of those players proves it.<br/>And to say they will simply adapt is false - we all remember what happened with Daigo when he was forced to change to Yun after Ryu's nerfs in AE 2011.</p>

<p>What happened in SFxT should have stayed in SFxT. Grr.</p>
