I. Neutral
----------

    a. Overview

        Fragmentum is a really strong tool to have in neutral. If you can get
        these out safely, they will threaten just by occupying areas near your attack
        ranges. Use Vatista's lasers, balls, and normals to get out Fragmentum safely.

        Blockstrings:

            * 3C > cr.Fragmentum

                1. j.[9]A > j.A (detonate) > B Drill

                    This blockstring sets up a high/low mix-up. The second j.A
                    comes out when you are falling from the jump. Confirm that j.A
                    is blocked then cancel it into B Drill to create a fuzzy guard.

                    Note that there is a gap between j.A and the B Drill. EX Reversal
                    moves can get out of this setup as well as a well-timed backstep.

                    Another way for the opponent to get out of this setup is to Shield
                    the falling j.A. In doing so, Vatista will be unable to cancel into
                    B Drill.



    b. GRD Control:

         Crouching Fragmentum Set > Concentrate

         Observed from an Atepo match versus Hyde. Establish that you are 
         willing to detonate Fragmentum in neutral to cover the space in 
         front of you. Then, if you set a Crouching Fragmentum you can 
         stay behind it from 5A distance and use this time to Concentrate 
         and build GRD.

    c. Case Study

        These are situations in matches that can be 

        vs Hyde -> Black Orbiter:

II. Combo
---------

    Corner j.C:

         j.C > 2C > 5C > jc[9] > j.A > j.[B] > j.]8[2A > 2[C] > 2]B[ > 2A > 2B 
         > 2]C[ > delay j.B (detonate) okizeme

    Hyde Craver Punish:

        2C High Counter > 5C > jc[9] > j.A > j.B > j.]8[2[A] > 2[C] > 
        5B > 5]A[> 5A > 5B > 2]C[ > VO (detonate) > j.[9]C > j.FF > 
        j.]8[2C > IW okizeme (dash crouch Fragmentum)

    ELTNUM

        03/16/2014: atepo(VA) vs. Eltnum 
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73EDkXrc6lQ#t=13

        Start:
            EL can start the match off with gun shot. This will beat out all of your options unless you have meter for EX H. Laser ([6]4C).

            If you got shot, neutral tech and hold up-back to charge for Orb and use j.C to establish your space. Launch A Ball if 
                VA can jump back and try to use air A Ball.
