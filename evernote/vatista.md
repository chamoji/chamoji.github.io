    b. GRD Control:

         willing to detonate Fragmentum in neutral to cover the space in 
         front of you. Then, if you set a Crouching Fragmentum you can 
         stay behind it from 5A distance and use this time to Concentrate 
         and build GRD.

    ELTNUM

        03/16/2014: atepo(VA) vs. Eltnum 
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73EDkXrc6lQ#t=13

        Start:
            EL can start the match off with gun shot. This will beat out all of your options unless you have meter for EX H. Laser ([6]4C).

            If you got shot, neutral tech and hold up-back to charge for Orb and use j.C to establish your space. Launch A Ball if 
                VA can jump back and try to use air A Ball.
