Character: Yuzuriha
===================

Progress
--------

Potential Main? She has fun normals. Long pokes. Fun combos. I think if I
play her enough it will all become natural. For now I will probably have
to watch more videos of stronger Japanese players and study from there.

Particularly, I want to look at what those players do for:

1. Opening Moves
	Currently I just go for 2C or jump backwards and try to snipe with j.236A

2. Neutral Game
	2C is my main tool but I feel like I'm missing something else here.
	Also, once I have the opponent cornered, I want to know how to optimize my advantages there.

3. Hitconfirms
	I need major work in this aspect of the game. I need to look at what kinds of combo routes top players go to when going for abare.
