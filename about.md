Welcome to nosound.

I believe in honest, hard work. Therefore, I started this blog to detail my
thoughts on self-improvement as well as log my progress in various fields
of study (mostly recreational activities).

As far back as my middle school years, I was fascinated with becoming skilled
at something. Magicians, craftsman, artist, writers, you name it. I do not
buy into the belief that someone who exhibits mastery in something is 
neccessarily a genius. On the contrary, I think when people dismiss someone's
extraordinary efforts as a result of natural talent or innate genius, it is
insulting to the reality of things.
