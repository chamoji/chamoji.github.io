It is my understanding that a lot of what goes into mastering a particular
skill or field of work is often dismissed as "talent" or is only possible
because of a "natural gift".

While I do believe there is some factor involving natural abilities, in the
end of it all, becoming great at something is attained moreso with focused,
deliberate practice rather than just pure talents or innate abilities.
