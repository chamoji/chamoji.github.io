Some thoughts while training for EVO: 

- Which matchups give me the most trouble?
- How many of my victories can I account to pure knowledge and execution?
- What type of player is this person?
- Is there a better option than this move?
- What are the common tendencies did I observe across multiple players
  playing the same character?

When you actually have a target in mind while practicing, it becomes 
much clearer what you want to work on. The pressure to meet the demands
of a big tournament only accelerate the rate at which you want to improve.
