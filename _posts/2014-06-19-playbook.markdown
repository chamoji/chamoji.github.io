This is how I do things. Everything here is 100% faithful to what I do
in matches.


General Opening Moves
=====================
The opening move to take as Rachel depends on the matchup. I always aim
to get pumpkin out as soon as possible. Therefore, I have to look at the
entire cast and see what I can do to accomplish this goal.


Restricted Opening
------------------
These are matchups in which your opponent has options to threaten you as
soon as the match begins. The easiest example would be against Terumi. 
He can use 5D to tag you at match start so I would take a defensive opening
move there.

- j.77 > j.214B (pumpkin)
- 44D (backstep) > 214B (pumpkin)
