EVO registration is officially closed.

The waiting game begins. Three days prior to the start of EVO, the pool
assignments will be announced. I am truly hoping that I get all of the
strong players. In fact, I want to fight N-O first thing. What does it
feel like to go against the best? 

Bracket Preview
---------------

It looks like I have Galileo (Litchi) in my pool. My first match is up against
another USA player I have never heard of. Have to expect anything and be 
prepared.

I am in pool J11 for BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma (BBCP). Bracket H is
where I start!

Highlighted in yellow are players that I have played / met / or know about.

Preparation
-----------
I ran a set against a Hakumen yesterday at the online arcade lobby.

*10 consecutive wins!* 

But, somehow, the player just afk'd and I was unable to get another match.
