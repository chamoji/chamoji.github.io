EVO registration is officially closed.

The waiting game begins. Three days prior to the start of EVO, the pool
assignments will be announced. I am truly hoping that I get all of the
strong players. In fact, I want to fight N-O first thing. What does it
feel like to go against the best? 

Bracket Preview
---------------

It looks like I have Galileo (Litchi) in my pool. My first match is up against
another USA player I have never heard of. Have to expect anything and be 
prepared.
