Pools: Shark-Infested Waters
----------------------------

My pools were scheduled for the afternoon. I arrived a couple of minutes early at the pool station. My opponent was about to get disqualified for not being present for our match. Fortunately, he arrived so my first match began and it was streamed no less. Now, usually people breath a sigh of relief when they get a "bye" in a tournament. I did not want that for my first match since I needed to warm-up. Thankfully I got the match and I won.

My matchups were not too bad. I believe the first match was against Bang? After that I had to fight Tager. Finally, in the winner's side of the bracket I had to face Tochigin in the quarterfinals. Rachel versus Azrael is heavily momentum based. Most rounds are taken in a convincing manner with Rachel cornering Azrael into death or Azrael making one decisive read and riding the momentum to victory.

There was no contest though, after the first round I was already figured out. Eventually I was knocked into the loser's bracket by Tochigin.

My final match was against LordSpectreX (UK Azrael). He too was a strong player. It was a close set but my neutral was weak and he closed it out to eliminate me from the tournament completely. I went 3-2 in my pool losing only to Azrael players. Eventually Tochigin would place in the top 8.

Lessons Learned
---------------

Having been to EVO in 2011 and now in 2014, I have the following advice for any future competitors:

![EVO2014 - Hotel Room](/assets/evo2014/02.jpg)
*Plan ahead*:

If possible, book your hotel room early and get to the EVO venue early. This will give you plenty of time to figure out where everything is, where your pool stations are, and more importantly you will have plenty of time to relax.

![EVO2014 - Casuals](/assets/evo2014/13.jpg)
*More than casual*:

Get some casual sessions in before your pools start. If possible, ask around if anyone is hosting in their room. Primarily, playing casuals is a way to warm-up. Secondly, you can chat amongst players to gain some perspective on the game. While you may not agree what others have to say, sometimes a different viewpoint on the game will open up your mind to more effective strategies that you otherwise would not have considered.

*Bring out the best*:

When it comes time for your pools you might get nervous. It is okay to be a little nervous, I take it as a sign that you are invested in winning and care about the game. The next step is to turn the nervousness into an advantage by using it as a catalyst for staying alert.

The best lesson I learned was to stick with your plan. Do not be shy about the way you play. I felt that I was guilty of this in my pool play so I want to dig a little deeper and find out how I can avoid this mistake.

*Enjoy yourself*

Have fun out there. It's not all serious time. The people are what make the events memorable. So go out there and play some damn fighting games with some people. Happy mashing.
