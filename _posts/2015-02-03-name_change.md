chamoji is the combination of my middle name and my last name.
In Japanese, it might carry the meaning "Tea Character" if taken literally. 

Not sure but I think I like it.

chamoji will be used for any programming work I do,
whereas glidesu is strictly for gaming related stuff (score rankings, tournaments, etc.)

Thank you for playing.
