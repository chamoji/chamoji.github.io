Admittedly, I have not watched many match videos of other Rachel players.
I recently saw some footage of Team Rachel versus Team Kokonoe in 1.1.

Some notes after watching some more videos of top players:

- Rachel vs. Kokonoe is most likely an even matchup (version 1.1)

- Wind tech becomes almost a neccessity if you want to consistently win
  with Rachel. 

- 2C is not really a true reversal but it can be used that way. I felt like
  the 2C usage in the JP videos were not because they were trying to get
  out of a bad situation as a primary goal. It's more that 2C was used to
  condition the opponent first rather than going for the "safest" option
  right out.

 Rachel in the 1.1 patch will be a problem for anyone. I want to be the guy
 providing the problem ƪ(Ơ̴̴̴̴̴̴͡.̮Ơ̴̴͡)ʃ
