EVO2015 has come and gone. I have found a new source of inspiration.

The amount of effort the top players have put in is overwhelming:

1. SKD takes 1st place in BBCPEX with his unique Izayoi.

2. Ogawa is the pinnacle of high-level Guilty Gear play. A decade of 
dominance with his Zato/Eddie has placed him as the most successful 
Guilty Gear player in history.

3. Gamerbee is just bonkers in how he was able to dig deep, rebel, and make
it to grand finals.

4. Momochi faced arcade stick malfunctions on the final game but still 
managed to clinch the win.

_Having seen all of this unfold has made me realize how much more effort I 
can put in my own work._
