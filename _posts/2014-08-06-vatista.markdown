## How chuu2 are you? ##

I was skeptical at first, but I ended up becoming a Vatista main.
At first glance, when UNI was just screenshots and loketest videos, I wanted to play Gordeau.
After playing him, I just was not having fun playing as him. 

*It's not that I couldn't win with him.*
I won a lot of games with Gordeau knowing only one basic combo-part and a basic understanding 
of his mix-up options. So that definitely was not the problem! 

Perhaps it's a cop out answer but quite honestly, I just was not "feeling it" while I played matches.

**I decided to branch out...**

## It's fun to lose. ##

With Vatista I had fun the very first match I got to play with another human opponent.
At around 200 matches on netplay I tanked to around 30% win rate with Vatista on my 
"glirandly" account. Despite this, I was having a great time figuring out how exactly all of
her tools work. I lost a lot of games before I could get comfortable with her commands.

Armed with my trusty LGP that I had recently purchased, I proceeded to stay in training mode until
I could execute a working game plan with Vatista. You cannot expect to win consistently with just 
one style of play alone. I studied a lot of my own replays and tried to compare where I differed 
from other players, especially top players such as "atepo". 

It takes more than passively watching matches. Ask yourself some questions and engage yourself
with the conversation that's taking place. What is the reply to X character's pressure?
Why is Y player just standing there doing nothing?

So, I started anew with my "glidesu" account. This one is my JP account that I use to purchase JP only
PSN titles. With some well needed training mode grinded out I felt more confident in my Vatista play.

A couple of days later, the fruits of my labor came.

I was happy with this and I enjoyed the journey. I will continue to play this game even if it's not
"the hot new title" for competitive play.
