## How chuu2 are you? ##

I was skeptical at first, but I ended up becoming a Vatista main.
At first glance, when UNI was just screenshots and loketest videos, I wanted to play Gordeau.
After playing him, I just was not having fun playing as him. 

*It's not that I couldn't win with him.*
I won a lot of games with Gordeau knowing only one basic combo-part and a basic understanding 
of his mix-up options. So that definitely was not the problem! 

Perhaps it's a cop out answer but quite honestly, I just was not "feeling it" while I played matches.

**I decided to branch out...**

## It's fun to lose. ##

With Vatista I had fun the very first match I got to play with another human opponent.
At around 200 matches on netplay only I had something around 30% win rate with Vatista on my 
"glirandly" account. Despite this, I was having a great time figuring out how exactly all of
her tools work. I lost a lot of games before I could get comfortable with her commands.

Armed with my trusty LGP that I had recently purchased, I proceeded to stay in training mode until
I could execute a working game plan with Vatista. You cannot expect to win consistently with just 
one style of play alone.

I have studied a lot and tried to take away whatever it was that I found useful. 
At work I even took notes and watched match videos during downtime.

So, with some well-needed training mode grinded out and a couple of days later, the fruits of my labor came:
