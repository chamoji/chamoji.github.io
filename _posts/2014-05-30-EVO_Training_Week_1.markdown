title: "EVO Training - Week 1"
date: 2014-05-30

While this is not my first EVO event, it is my first time seriously preparing
for one. I will participate only in BlazBlue but I will more than likely
pick up USF4 and compete in future Street Fighter events. 

This post is dedicated to logging my progress regarding BBCP training in
preparation for EVO. I have a little over one month to target specific areas
of my play that present obvious weaknesses and improve upon those areas.

Week 1
------
A shaky start for training. Had to experiment when I was the most alert so I
could analyze my matches with my full attention and focus. 

Weekdays
--------
- 07:00 > Review replays marked for analysis.
- 07:30 > Training mode. Investigate issues related to notes taken from
          replay analysis.
- 08:00 > Prepare for Work
- 19:00 > Home from Work. Eat dinner.
- 21:00 > Netplay. Save replays that contain issues worth exploring.
- 00:00 > Sleep.

In the morning, there are significantly less players online. Therefore 
it is the perfect time for me to watch replays, take notes, and grind out
answers in training mode. I have to stop at 08:00 since I have to prepare for work. 

Once I am at work, I squeeze any downtime I have into watching match videos
or look up any additional information that I would want to apply or explore
once I get home.

The important part is the 21:00 netplay session. Any match, regardless if I
win or lose, I will save for viewing if I notice something unusual or if a
certain playstyle sticks out that gives me trouble. Really cannot go wrong
when it comes to self-reflection on your own play. I do not immediately watch
these replays. I save them for the mornings. From there, the cycle continues...

Ending thoughts
---------------
Not a bad first week. 

What I am looking for in logging my progress are ways to improve the training
process.

Ideally the cycle of improvement / learning for me would be:
1. A way to capture data. 

This is easily done by just playing matches and 
saving replays.

2. A way to analyze this data. 

Logically, you will watch the replays and 
take notes.

3. A way to get feedback. 

Training mode + offline sessions
+ online sessions = immediate feedback.

Without feedback, you are wasting time. How can you tell what to adjust if 
there is nothing to measure your data with?
