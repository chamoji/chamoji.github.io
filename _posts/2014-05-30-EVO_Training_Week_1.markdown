title: "EVO Training - Week 1"
date: 2014-05-30
---

While this is not my first EVO event, it is my first time seriously preparing
for one. I will participate only in BlazBlue but I will more than likely
pick up USF4 and compete in future Street Fighter events. 

This post is dedicated to logging my progress regarding BBCP training in
preparation for EVO. I have a little over one month to target specific areas
of my play that present obvious weaknesses and improve upon those areas.

Week 1
------
A shaky start for training. Had to experiment when I was the most alert so I
could analyze my matches with my full attention and focus. 

Weekdays
--------
- 07:00 > Review replays marked for analysis.
- 07:30 > Training mode. Investigate issues related to notes taken from
          replay analysis.
- 08:00 > Prepare for Work
- 19:00 > Home from Work. Eat dinner.
- 21:00 > Netplay. Save replays that contain issues worth exploring.
- 00:00 > Sleep.

In the morning, there are significantly less players online. Therefore 
it is the perfect time for me to watch replays, take notes, and grind out
answers in training mode. I have to stop at 08:00 since I have to prepare for work. 

Once I am at work, I squeeze any downtime I have into watching match videos
or look up any additional information that I would want to apply or explore
once I get home.

The important part is the 21:00 netplay session. Any match, regardless if I
win or lose, I will save for viewing if I notice something unusual or if a
certain playstyle sticks out that gives me trouble. Really cannot go wrong
when it comes to self-reflection on your own play. I do not immediately watch
these replays. I save them for the mornings. From there, the cycle continues...

Ending thoughts
---------------
Not a bad first week. 

What I am looking for in logging my progress are ways to improve the training
process.

The main components are the following:
- A way to capture data.
- A way to analyze the data.
- A way to get feedback based on changes you make from analysis.

With saved replays I have come up with a simple cycle.
1. Netplay. Save replays that you believe are worth analyzing.
2. Study those replays and take notes. 
3. Return to netplay and apply what you noted. Go to Step 1 as needed 
   and repeat the cycle.

Without feedback, you are wasting time. How can you tell what to adjust if 
there is nothing to measure your data with?
