Dizzy vs. Ramlethal

Dizzy's Advantages

1. Air movement
2. Long sweep
3. 2S anti-air

Ramlethal's Advantages

1. Superior normals with swords.
2. Overhead options have high-return.
3. Corner trap often leads to one-chance game for opponent.

Dizzy's Strategy

This is an uphill battle for Dizzy due to her slower attacks compared to Ram.

Instead of attacking Ram head-on, Dizzy should use her air dashes to create
space for bubbles and establish an offense through indirect attacks.

Once you are able to get a bubble out, pay attention to how Ram responds to
the threat:

		1. You can 2S her [H]j.H approaches by dashing under her.

		2. If Ram is lower to the ground and farther away, use 4S instead.

		3. If you see that there are swords deployed you can disable them by 
		popping a nearby bubble OR you can do a quick IAD backwards j.D.

Once you are able to score a knockdown, you will want to priortize corner 
carry. 

Ideally, P Fish into throw/high/low is the best threat against Ram in the corner.

Keep your back out of the corner. Burst if you need to. Use Imperial Ray to accomplish both goals of corner carry + get out of corner.
