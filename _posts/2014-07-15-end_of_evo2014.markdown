Shark-Infested Waters: Saturday Pool Play
-----------------------------------------

My pools were scheduled for the afternoon. I arrived a couple of minutes early at the pool station. My opponent was about to get disqualified for not being present for our match. Fortunately, he arrived so my first match began and it was streamed no less.

Now, usually people breath a sigh of relief when they get a "bye" in a tournament. I did not want that for my first match since I needed to warm-up. Thankfully I got the match and I won.

My matchups were not too bad. I cannot remember the characters played in my first few matches. I believe the first match was against Bang? After that I had to fight Tager. Finally, in the winner's side of the bracket I had to face Tochigin in the quarterfinals. Rachel versus Azrael is heavily momentum based. Most rounds are taken in a convincing manner with Rachel cornering Azrael into death or Azrael makes one decisive read and rides the momentum to victory.
