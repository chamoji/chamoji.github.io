The adventure started here.

Breakfast was the standard McDonalds hash browns and sausage biscuits.
1 large sweet tea for me and one for my brother.

Work was long but it was finally time to depart for EVO. No more worries
about my job. Just games and people I heard of / knew about who also
enjoy those games.
